    description: "The rise of LLM-based conversational agents has led to increased disclosure of sensitive information, yet current systems lack user control over privacy-utility tradeoffs. We present Rescriber, a browser extension that enables user-led data minimization by detecting and sanitizing personal information in prompts. In a study (N=12), Rescriber reduced unnecessary disclosures and addressed user privacy concerns. Users rated the Llama3-8B-powered system comparably to GPT-4o. Trust was shaped by the tool’s consistency and comprehensiveness. Our findings highlight the promise of lightweight, on-device privacy controls for enhancing trust and protection in AI systems."
