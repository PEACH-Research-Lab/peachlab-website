    description: "Behavior change is the process of modifying an individual's behavior in a deliberate and lasting way through the use of technology. This could include anything from encouraging physical activity through wearable devices to encouraging a certain behavior change through social interactions. We aim to design technology that not only improves user experience but also promotes desirable changes in behavior."
